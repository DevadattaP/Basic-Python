# Python Programming Practicals (Semester 4 - Computer Science Engineering, AI & ML)

This repository contains a collection of practical programs implemented as part of the Python Programming course (Semester 4) in the Computer Science Engineering (AI & ML) curriculum at the University of Mumbai. The programs are written and executed using Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb`), which can be run on platforms like Google Colab or locally using Jupyter.

## Introduction

This repository contains Python programs covering fundamental to advanced concepts such as data types, control structures, object-oriented programming, and data handling using libraries like NumPy and Pandas. Each practical is designed to strengthen the understanding of Python programming by focusing on various real-world problems and algorithmic solutions.

## Programs Included

The repository contains the following practical programs:

1. **Basic Concepts**: Variables, data types, operators, string concatenation, input/output.
2. **Collections**: List, tuple, set, dictionary operations, string slicing.
3. **Control Statements & Loops**: `if`, `if-else`, nested `if`, `while`, `for` loops.
4. **Functions**: Functions with/without parameters, return values, lambda functions.
5. **File Handling**: Reading from and writing to files.
6. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Classes, objects, constructors, methods.
7. **Inheritance**: Single and multiple inheritance.
8. **Advanced OOP**: Duck typing, operator overloading, method overloading, and method overriding.
9. **Exception Handling**: Handling errors and exceptions.
10. **NumPy**: Working with arrays and performing operations.
11. **Linked List**: Implementation of linked lists.
12. **Data Handling with Pandas**: Manipulating data using Pandas.

## Prerequisites

To run these programs, you'll need:

- **Google Colab** or **Jupyter Notebook** to run the `.ipynb` files.
- Basic understanding of Python programming and object-oriented principles.
- Python libraries such as NumPy and Pandas, which are required for specific programs.

## How to Run

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/DevadattaP/Basic-Python.git
   cd Python-Practicals
    ```
2. **Open Notebooks in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook:**
    - Google Colab: Upload the .ipynb files to Colab and run the cells interactively.
    - Jupyter Notebook: If Jupyter is installed locally, run the following command in the terminal:
        ```sh
        jupyter notebook
        ```
        Open the desired .ipynb file from the browser and run the cells.
